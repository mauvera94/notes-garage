Welcome to my personal notes repository! These notes reflect my thoughts, ideas, and ongoing experiments in thinking and learning. They are messy, half-formed, and unapologetically unpolished—just like the creative process.

## About This Repository
Hi, I’m [Mau Vera](https://mauvera.me), and these are my personal notes—well, the ones I’ve decided to share. Inspired by the idea of [working with the garage door open](https://austinkleon.com/2022/12/10/working-with-the-garage-door-open/), this repository offers a glimpse into my unfiltered thought process.

### What to Expect
- **Messy and Incomplete Notes**: These notes are written primarily for me, so they may be fragmented or lack context.
- **Connections and Links**: Many notes link to others, creating a web of ideas.
- **Frequent Updates**: This is a living repository that evolves as I add, refine, or rewrite notes.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy exploring!

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The best way to experience these notes is through my published website: [notesgarage.com](https://notesgarage.com). The website provides an intuitive interface for navigating and interacting with the content (Use desktop for best experience).

## What is Obsidian?
This repository is powered by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a tool that uses plain text Markdown files to organize and link ideas. It’s where I draft, connect, and refine my thoughts before they evolve into more polished content.
