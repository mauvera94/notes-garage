The onboarding process can have various screens, steps, processes, and validations. However, the *Onboarding Completion Rate* should be visualized as a pipeline and answer the question: **What percentage of all the users who started with a signup got activated?**

It is a use-case of the more general [[Overall Product Conversion Rate]].

> [!formula] 
> ${Onboarding\ Rate\ \%}=\dfrac{SUM(Activated\ Users)}{SUM(Sign-ups)}$

One thing to increase the Onboarding Completion Rate is to increase the [[Conversion Rate]] of each of its steps or reduce the [[Drop Off Rate]], with each change/initiative can calculate the impact it will have in the completition rate ([[Estimating the Impact of Changes in Funnel Steps on Overall Conversion Rate]]).

### Why is it important?

Onboarding is the literally first impression a user has with your product, that experience will create the expectation of their experience with you.

A high onboarding rate indicates that your product (or at least your onboarding process) is easy to use, intuitive, and provides value to customers quickly. This can lead to increased customer base, [[monthly active users]], and ultimately, revenue growth.
