Percentage of users that completed the onboarding process successfully.

The onboarding process can have various screens, steps, processes, and validations. However, the *Onboarding Completion Rate* should be visualized as a pipeline and answer the question: **What percentage of all the users who started with a signup got activated?**

> [!formula] 
> ${Onboarding\ Rate\ \%}=\dfrac{SUM(Activated\ Users)}{SUM(Sign-ups)}$

One thing to increase the Onboarding Completion Rate is to increase [[Conversion Rate]] of each of its steps or reduce the [[Drop Off Rate]], with each change you may calculate the [[Overall Conversion Improvement]].

### Why is it important?

Onboarding is the literally first impression a user has with your product, that experience will create the expectation of their experience with you.

A high onboarding rate indicates that your product (or at least your onboarding process) is easy to use, intuitive, and provides value to customers quickly. This can lead to increased customer base, [[monthly active users]], and ultimately, revenue growth.
