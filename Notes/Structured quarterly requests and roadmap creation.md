> - This process is **not rigid**—adjust as needed based on team size, company priorities, and available resources.
> - Flexibility is key—ensure iterative improvements to optimize the process over time.

## 1. Initiative Gathering & Intake
**Goal:** Collect and document initiatives from various stakeholders.

### Steps:
- Share an **initiative submission template** to ensure standardized inputs.
- Communicate that this is an **intake process, not the final roadmap**.
- Set a **submission deadline** to allow time for prioritization and planning.
- Request key details for each initiative, such as:
  - Description
  - Estimated Impact
  - Why It Matters
  - Point of Contact (POC)
  - Suggested Priority
  - Dependencies & Risks
  - Estimated Effort (S/M/L)
  - Expected Timeline
  - Cross-Team Involvement
- Incomplete submissions may require follow-ups for clarification.

---

## 2. Creating Initiative One-Pagers
**Goal:** Summarize each initiative for evaluation and prioritization.

### Considerations:
- One-pagers should include:
  - Problem statement
  - Proposed solution
  - Expected impact (qualitative and quantitative)
  - Dependencies & risks
  - Effort estimate (S/M/L)
  - Key stakeholders
- One-pagers should be refined with **POCs and relevant teams** for accuracy.

---

## 3. Identifying Blockers & Dependencies
**Goal:** Surface and resolve potential blockers before prioritization.

### Steps:
- Meet with teams (e.g., engineering, design, operations) to:
  - Identify technical, resource, or operational constraints.
  - Highlight cross-team dependencies.
  - Surface feasibility risks.
- Document blockers and dependencies in the **initiative tracker**.

---

## 4. Estimating Impact & Capacity
**Goal:** Ensure alignment between available capacity and initiative scope.

### Considerations:
- Work with **core teams** (engineering, design, operations) to:
  - Assign estimated effort (S/M/L).
  - Adjust scope if needed to fit within capacity.
- Estimate impact based on:
  - Business growth
  - Operational efficiency
  - Customer experience improvements
  - Risk reduction
- Prioritize initiatives based on **impact vs. effort trade-offs**.

---

## 5. Prioritization & Tradeoffs
**Goal:** Balance high-impact initiatives against constraints.

### Options for Prioritization:
- Use a **framework** (e.g., RICE, MoSCoW, ICE) to rank initiatives.
- Discuss **tradeoffs with stakeholders**:
  - Quick wins vs. long-term bets
  - High-impact vs. high-effort projects
- Align on a **final ranked list** for leadership review.

---

## 6. Leadership Alignment
**Goal:** Validate priorities and secure leadership buy-in.

### Steps:
- Present the **proposed roadmap** including:
  - Key initiatives and expected impact
  - Tradeoffs made
  - Any remaining open risks or blockers
- Gather **leadership feedback** and adjust as needed.

---

## 7. Creating PRDs & Detailing Requirements
**Goal:** Define clear specifications for execution before finalizing the roadmap.

### Steps:
- Create **Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)** for each high-priority initiative.
  - Define the **problem statement** and success metrics.
  - Detail **functional & technical requirements**.
  - Outline **user stories and use cases**.
  - Identify **dependencies & risks**.
  - Specify **acceptance criteria**.
- Collaborate with **engineering, design, and cross-functional teams** to refine details.
- Ensure initiatives have **well-defined scope and feasibility** before final commitment.

---

## 8. Finalizing & Categorizing the Roadmap
**Goal:** Define clear initiative categories to align expectations.

### Roadmap Categories:
1. **Committed:**  
   - High-priority initiatives with leadership alignment and clear execution plans.
2. **Stretch Goals:**  
   - Initiatives targeted for delivery, dependent on capacity.
3. **Non-Prioritized:**  
   - Initiatives that are deprioritized but may be revisited later.

---

## 9. Communicating the Roadmap
**Goal:** Ensure visibility and alignment across teams.

Start [[Structured Product Development Checkpoints]]
### Options for Communication:
- **Create a visual roadmap** (slide deck, Google sheets, Notion page, Confluence, etc.).
- **Host a roadmap review session** to:
  - Present key priorities.
  - Address outstanding questions.
  - Align on execution timelines.
- **Send an async update** via email, Slack, or internal documentation with:
  - A roadmap summary.
  - Next steps and execution plans.
  - A feedback loop for additional input.
