> CAC represents how much a company spends to acquire a customer.

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) measures the total cost a company incurs to acquire a new customer. It is calculated as:

> [!formula] 
> $\text{CAC} = \frac{\text{Total Acquisition Expenses}}{\text{Number of New Customers}}$
> - Acquisition Expenses:
> 	- *Simplified*: Marketing and sales cost for acquiring customers (not regular customers)
> 	- *Complex method* (Sometimes referred as *Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)*): Marketing cost for acquiring customers + Wages connected with sales and marketing + Software cost (Eg. CRM, A/B-testing, analytics...)+ Additional professional services (Designer, consultants...) + Any other expense related to Acquisition efforts

### Why CAC Matters
CAC helps businesses understand **how much they are spending to gain new customers**. A high CAC may indicate inefficiencies in marketing or sales efforts, whereas a low CAC suggests an effective acquisition strategy.

### CAC and Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
To assess financial sustainability, CAC is often compared to [[Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV)]], which represents the total revenue a customer is expected to generate over their relationship with the company. The LTV:CAC ratio provides insight into the profitability of acquiring customers:

- **LTV > CAC**: The business model is financially viable, as each customer generates more revenue than their acquisition cost.
- **LTV < CAC**: The company is losing money on customer acquisition and may need to refine its strategy.
- **LTV:CAC Ratio of 3:1**: A commonly cited benchmark for a healthy business, indicating that customers generate three times the revenue of their acquisition cost.

### Strategies to Optimize CAC
- **Improve [[Onboarding Completion Rate]]**: Enhance website UX, optimize sales funnels, and refine messaging to increase conversions.
- **Leverage Organic Channels**: SEO, content marketing, and referrals can reduce dependency on paid ads or sales commissions.
- **Retargeting and Personalization**: Tailoring marketing efforts improves engagement and acquisition efficiency.
- **Optimize Ad Spend**: Testing and iterating on paid campaigns ensures more efficient spending.
