The percentage of users who continue using a product after a specified period. It is the inverse of [[churn rate]] and serves as a key metric for evaluating *customer engagement and long-term business sustainability*.

## Importance

- A high retention rate indicates a strong product-market fit and user satisfaction.
- Retained users tend to have a higher [[Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV)]], making them more profitable over time.
- Customer acquisition is often more expensive than retention, making retention a cost-effective growth strategy.
- Loyal users can become brand advocates, driving organic growth through [[word-of-mouth]].

## Factors Influencing Retention

1. **Product Satisfaction** – The product must effectively solve the user’s problem and meet expectations.
2. **Cost-Benefit Perception** – Users weigh not only monetary costs but also time, effort, and attention required to use the product.
3. **Enhanced Value Over Time** – Some products gain increasing value as more users engage with them (e.g., [[network effects]] in social platforms or marketplaces).
4. **Absence of Negative or Painful Experiences** – Users are more likely to stay if they do not encounter frustrations, such as poor customer support, technical issues, or intrusive ads.
5. **Availability of Alternatives** – Retention is higher when users perceive a lack of comparable alternatives.
