This [[§ Mental Models|Mental Model]] emphasizes the **distinction between representations and reality**. This idea highlights how models, symbols, and *descriptions of reality are not reality itself*. While maps (or models) help navigate complex systems, they always involve simplifications and omissions.

## Key Insights

- **Abstraction vs. Reality**: Any model, be it a physical map, documentation, or a mental framework, is a simplified representation of something more complex. It captures essential aspects while omitting details.

- **Utility vs. Accuracy**: A useful model does not need to be fully accurate, only sufficiently reliable for its intended purpose. Over-reliance on models can lead to misinterpretations when they fail to capture critical nuances.

- **Updating Maps**: As the territory (reality) evolves, maps must be updated. Rigid adherence to outdated models can lead to systematic errors and poor decision-making.

- **Cognitive Bias and Map Errors**: People often mistake their mental models for reality, leading to confirmation bias and misjudgment when reality does not conform to expectations.

>The map of reality is not reality. Even the best maps are imperfect. That’s because maps are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. A map can also be a snapshot from a point in time, representing something that no longer exists. This is important to keep in mind as we think through problems and seek to make better decisions.

>Reality is messy and complicated, so our tendency to simplify it is understandable. However, if the aim becomes simplification rather than understanding, we start to make bad decisions. When we mistake the map for the territory, we start to think we have all the answers. We create static rules or policies that deal with the map but forget that we exist in a constantly changing world

>Maps and models are not meant to live forever as static references. The world is dynamic. As territories change, our tools to navigate them must be flexible, to handle a wide variety of situations or adapt to the changing times. If the value of a map or model is related to its ability to predict or explain, then it needs to represent reality. If reality has changed, the map must change.

> In order to use a map or model as accurately as possible, we should take into account three important principles:
> 1. Reality is the ultimate update.
> 2. Consider the cartographer.
> 3. Maps can influence territories.
