> **Business as Usual (BAU)** refers to the ongoing, routine operational tasks that maintain stability, functionality, compliance, and risk mitigation in an organization, separate from strategic initiatives or major changes.

Business as Usual (BAU) refers to the standard, ongoing operational tasks that keep an organization functioning. It contrasts with strategic projects or initiatives that introduce change. BAU activities ensure stability, continuity, and efficiency while organizations pursue innovation and growth.

## Characteristics of BAU

- **Routine and Ongoing:** BAU encompasses daily operations, maintenance, and incremental improvements.
- **Predictable and Stable:** These activities sustain core business functions without significant transformation.
- **Resource-Driven:** BAU tasks often consume a major portion of operational capacity, with companies balancing resources between BAU and innovation.
- **Distinct from Strategic Projects:** While projects aim for change and growth, BAU ensures reliability and efficiency in existing processes.

## BAU in Product and Operations Management

### 1. **Parallel Execution with Strategic Initiatives**

- **BAU ensures stability:** Routine maintenance, bug fixes, and security updates support ongoing business operations.
- **Strategic projects drive innovation:** Large-scale changes, such as feature rollouts, introduce transformation.

### 2. **Prioritization & Resource Allocation**

- Companies allocate a percentage of resources to BAU vs. innovation.
- Overemphasizing BAU can lead to stagnation, while neglecting it increases technical debt and operational inefficiencies ([[Risks of Over-Prioritizing BAU or Strategic Initiatives]])

### 3. **Sprint Planning & Agile Execution**

- Agile teams incorporate BAU tasks into every sprint, alongside strategic projects.
- Kanban boards or backlog grooming help distinguish BAU from roadmap-driven initiatives.

### 4. **Scaling and Automation**
- Automating routine BAU processes (e.g., CI/CD, AI-driven support) reduces manual effort and allows teams to focus on innovation.

## Administrative and Daily BAU Tasks

Certain daily administrative tasks are also considered BAU, as they support ongoing operations without directly driving innovation. These include:

- **Communication & Coordination:** Answering emails, scheduling meetings, engaging with stakeholders.
- **Documentation & Updates:** Maintaining PRDs (Product Requirement Documents), updating project tracking tools, logging decisions.
- **Operational Support:** Reviewing reports, processing approvals, handling compliance checks.

While these tasks are *essential for smooth workflows, they do not introduce transformational change*. However, some administrative tasks can intersect with strategic work, such as drafting high-level communications that influence business direction or refining documentation that shapes major product initiatives.

## Example: BAU vs. Roadmap Initiative

**E-commerce Company Scenario:**

- **BAU:** Routine website updates, payment gateway maintenance, bug fixing, performance optimizations.
- **Roadmap Initiative:** Launching a new AI-powered product recommendation engine.
