Organizations often undergo restructuring as **a response to business challenges**. Leaders initiate reorgs to solve pain points such as missed goals, misaligned teams, underperforming leadership, imbalanced resources... From a leadership perspective, **a reorg is an attempt to realign the organization with strategic objectives**, even if the changes may not immediately make sense to employees.

## Key Considerations in Organizational Reorganizations

>[!help]
> Reorganizations are a natural part of business evolution, but they bring challenges in alignment, productivity, and psychological safety. Employees who proactively seek clarity, align their work with new business objectives, and assess their positioning within the organization can better navigate these transitions. Understanding leadership motivations and maintaining open communication are critical for ensuring that both individuals and teams thrive post-reorg.
