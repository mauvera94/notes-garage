## Core Difference
Project management focuses on **delivering a specific scope within a fixed timeframe and budget**, whereas product management is about **continuous iteration, long-term growth, and adapting to market needs**. A project has an end date; a product is an evolving entity.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Project Management | Product Management |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Budgeting | Fixed funding for a defined scope. New funding requires a new project. | Funding is based on product value streams, incentivizing continuous delivery. |
| Timeframe | Defined end date; no focus on post-project maintenance. | Ongoing lifecycle with continuous improvements and adaptations. |
| Success Measurement | Measured by delivering on time and on budget. | Measured by business outcomes and customer impact. |
| Risk Handling | Front-loaded learning and decisions, leading to rigidity. | Risk is spread over time, allowing for pivots and adaptive planning. |
| Team Structure | Teams assigned per project, leading to frequent churn and reassignment. | Stable, cross-functional teams focused on a continuous value stream. |
| Prioritization | Requirement-driven, often waterfall-oriented. | Roadmap and hypothesis-driven, aligning with Agile principles. |
| Visibility | Complex mapping, often obscure alignment to business goals. | Direct mapping to business outcomes, ensuring transparency. |

## Why Companies Should Shift to Product Thinking
1. **Adaptability in a Fast-Changing World** – The traditional project model assumes predictability, which is increasingly unrealistic. Product management allows companies to adjust to market shifts and customer feedback.
2. **Better Incentive Alignment** – In project management, incentives prioritize delivery over long-term value. Product-oriented companies focus on sustained success, reducing wasted effort.
3. **Customer-Centric Growth** – Product teams focus on solving real user problems, iterating continuously rather than delivering a one-time solution that may quickly become obsolete.
4. **More Effective Resource Allocation** – Stable, cross-functional teams improve collaboration, reducing inefficiencies caused by frequent team reassignment.

| Budgeting      | Funding of milestones, pre-defined at project scoping. New budget requires creation of a new project.                                                                                         | Funding of product value streams based on business results. New budget allocation based on demand. Incentive to deliver incremental results.                                                                        |
| Time frames    | Term of the project (e.g., one year). Defined end date. Not focused on the maintenance/health after the project ends.                                                                         | Life cycle of the product (multiple years), includes ongoing health/maintenance activities through end of life.                                                                                                     |
| Success        | Cost center approach. Measured to being on time and on budget. Capitalization of development results in large projects. Business incentivized to ask for everything they might need up front. | Profit center approach. Measured in business objectives and outcomes met (e.g., revenue). Focus on incremental value delivery and regular checkpoint.                                                               |
| Risk           | Delivery risks, such as product/market fit, is maximized by forcing all learning, specification, and strategic decision making to occur up front.                                             | Risk is spread across the time frame and iterations of the project. This creates option value, such as terminating the project if delivery assumptions were incorrect or pivoting if strategic opportunities arise. |
| Teams          | Bring people to the work: allocated up front, people often span multiple projects, frequent churn and re-assignment.                                                                          | Bring work to the people: stable, incrementally adjusted, cross-functional teams assigned to one value stream.                                                                                                      |
| Prioritization | PPM and project plan driven. Focus on requirements delivery. Projects drive waterfall orientation.                                                                                            | Roadmap and hypothesis testing driven. Focus on feature and business value delivery. Products drive Agile orientation.                                                                                              |
| Visibility     | IT is a black box. PMOs create complex mapping and obscurity.                                                                                                                                 | Direct mapping to business outcomes, enabling transparency.
