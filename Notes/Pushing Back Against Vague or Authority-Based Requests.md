When faced with feature requests justified by statements like "It's a legal requirement" or "It comes from senior leadership," consider the following approaches:
1. **Ask Out of Curiosity**: Approach the conversation as a learning opportunity rather than a challenge.
2. **Make "Why" Mandatory**: Require a clear justification in request forms and documentation.
3. **Frame It as a Benefit**: Explain that a well-defined "Why" increases the chances of prioritization and better execution.
4. **Highlight Dependencies**: Clarify that without a clear rationale, it's difficult to understand dependencies and tradeoffs.
5. **Escalate When Necessary**: If stakeholders refuse to provide justification, escalate the issue to ensure proper alignment.
