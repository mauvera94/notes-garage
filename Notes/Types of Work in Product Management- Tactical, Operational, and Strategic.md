## Understanding the Three Types of Work
Product management work can be categorized into three primary types:

### 1. Tactical Work (Execution-Focused)
- **Definition**: Involves hands-on execution, managing day-to-day tasks, and ensuring product development moves forward smoothly.
- **Examples**: Writing user stories & PRDs, working with engineering teams on sprint planning, QA testing, and resolving immediate issues.
- **Focus Areas & Skills Needed**: Attention to detail, communication with engineering teams, project management, and problem-solving.

### 2. Operational Work (Process & Optimization-Focused)
- **Definition**: Focuses on improving efficiency, coordinating teams, and ensuring cross-functional alignment.
- **Examples**: Defining workflows, improving release processes, managing stakeholder communication, and optimizing team efficiency.
- **Focus Areas & Skills Needed**: Process improvement, stakeholder management, data-driven decision-making, and organizational efficiency.

### 3. Strategic Work (Vision & Direction-Focused)
- **Definition**: Involves high-level decision-making, long-term planning, and setting the product vision and strategy.
- **Examples**: Defining product roadmaps, exploring market opportunities, setting business goals, and working on company-wide initiatives.
- **Focus Areas & Skills Needed**: Market research, strategic thinking, leadership, and business acumen.

## How Work Evolves Across PM Levels
The distribution of these work types shifts as a PM progresses through different levels:

- **Associate PMs & Product Managers:** Primarily handle **tactical work** with some exposure to operational tasks.
- **Senior PMs:** Split their time between **tactical and operational work**, with increasing involvement in strategic discussions.
- **Directors of Product:** Spend more time on **operational and strategic work**, ensuring product teams function efficiently while shaping future directions.
- **VPs of Product & CPOs:** Focus almost entirely on **strategic work**, guiding the company's product vision and aligning it with business goals.

## Key Takeaways
- As PMs progress, their focus shifts from execution to strategy.
- Tactical work is crucial at the junior level, but operational and strategic thinking become essential for senior roles.
- High-performing PMs balance all three areas, knowing when to dive into execution while maintaining a strategic outlook.
