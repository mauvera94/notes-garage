Session Frequency refers to the average number of sessions per user within a specific time frame (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly). It is a key behavioral metric that helps measure how often users engage with an application.

## Why It Matters
Session Frequency provides deeper insight into user engagement beyond [[Monthly Active Users (MAU)]]. While MAU tracks unique users over time, *session frequency reveals whether those users are engaging once or multiple times* within that period. It helps distinguish habitual users from one-time visitors.

## Session Frequency and Retention

- A high session frequency **can indicate strong engagement**, suggesting habitual or dependent usage of the app. This is often a positive retention signal.
- However, a high session frequency **is not always a sign of retention**. Users might be returning frequently due to usability issues, a confusing experience, or a blocker preventing conversion (e.g., a bug in the purchase flow causing repeated failed attempts).
