A project plan or roadmaps serve as a map, outlining the intended course of action, milestones, time and resource allocations. However, like all maps, it is a simplified representation and not the reality of project execution. Recognizing this distinction is critical for adaptive project, portfolio and product management.

- **Plans Are Simplifications**: A project plan captures essential details but cannot anticipate every variable, change, or unforeseen obstacle.
- **Deviations Are Inevitable**: Projects rarely follow a plan exactly. Delays, scope changes, and unforeseen risks require continuous adjustments.
- **Balancing Structure and Flexibility**: Overly rigid adherence to a plan can hinder responsiveness, while excessive fluidity can lead to chaos.

- **Iterative Refinement**: As new information emerges, project plans should be updated to remain relevant and useful.

## The Other Side: When Planning is Insufficient

- **Lack of Direction**: Without a clear plan, teams struggle with misalignment and inefficiencies.
- **Increased Uncertainty**: Poor planning leads to unexpected bottlenecks and scope creep.
- **Difficult Coordination**: Teams and stakeholders require a shared reference point to align expectations and responsibilities.
