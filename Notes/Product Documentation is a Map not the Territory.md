Internal product documentation, such as UI mockups in Figma or reference docs, serves as a map to guide teams through a productâ€™s design, features, and workflows. However, like all maps, it is a simplified and sometimes outdated representation of reality. This distinction is crucial for teams relying on documentation for decision-making.


- **Documentation as an Abstraction**: No documentation fully encapsulates the entire complexity of a product. It highlights essential structures while often failing to keep pace with real-time changes.
- **Gaps Between Documentation and Reality**: Teams frequently encounter discrepancies between design documents and the actual product, especially when updates or iterations are not immediately reflected.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Just as maps need updates to remain accurate, documentation must be continuously refined based on product evolution and team feedback.
- - **Balancing Detail and Usability**: Overloading documentation with excessive detail can make it bulky, while too much abstraction can lead to misunderstandings and misalignment.
- **Balancing Documentation with Implementation**: Documentation is important but it should never be prioritized over what brings impact: Doing the work and launching it:

## The Other Side: When Documentation is Insufficient

- **Navigation Becomes Slower**: Without adequate documentation, understanding and implementing changes take significantly longer as team members must rely on direct communication or trial and error.
- **Knowledge Silos**: Key insights and rationale behind decisions may be lost if they are not properly documented, leading to inefficiencies when onboarding new team members or revisiting past work.
- **Inconsistent Implementations**: Without clear documentation, different team members may interpret requirements differently, causing misalignment in the final product.
- **Increased Cognitive Load**: Teams must hold more contextual information in their heads, leading to a higher risk of errors and delays.
