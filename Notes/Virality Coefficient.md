*Quantifies how many new users are acquired through referrals* by existing users. It helps measure the self-sustaining nature of user growth in a product or service.

- **VC < 1**: Growth is insufficient to sustain itself; external acquisition is necessary.
- **VC = 1**: Each user brings in exactly one additional user, maintaining a steady state.
- **VC > 1**: Exponential growth occurs as each new user brings in more than one additional user.

### Strategies to Improve Virality
1. **Optimize Incentives**: Effective referral programs provide meaningful rewards while maintaining profitability.
2. **Reduce Friction**: Simplifying the referral process and [[Onboarding Completion Rate]] increases adoption.
3. **Leverage Behavioral Psychology**: Social proof, urgency, and exclusivity (e.g., waitlists, invite-only access) enhance viral loops.
4. **Align with User Motivations**: Users share more when referrals align with their interests and social identity.

### Importance in Growth Models
- **Crossing the Chasm**: A high VC helps move from early adopters to mainstream users.
- **Social Networks**: Growth depends on network effects, where more users increase value.
- **Pinwheel Effects**: Virality sustains momentum, reinforcing continuous user engagement.
- **Sustainable Growth**: Unlike paid acquisition, a high VC enables long-term, cost-effective expansion.
