## Agile as a Movement
Agile is fundamentally a movement that emerged to restore balance and effectiveness in traditional project management methodologies; it has become a cornerstone of modern software development.

It opposes rigid, heavyweight processes that hinder adaptability and responsiveness. Instead, Agile promotes flexibility, iterative progress, collaboration, and delivering value incrementally.

## The Essence of Agile
Agile is more than a set of frameworks—it is a philosophy described in the [[Agile Manifesto]] that thrives on adaptability, collaboration, and iterative learning. It allows teams to embrace uncertainty and evolve their processes as they discover better ways to deliver value.

## Agile as an Umbrella Term for Frameworks
Agile is not a single framework but an umbrella term encompassing various methodologies and practices that align with its core principles. Some of the most prominent Agile frameworks include:

- **Scrum** – Focuses on iterative development through time-boxed sprints and defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team).
- **Kanban** – Visualizes work in progress and optimizes flow to improve efficiency.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)** – Emphasizes technical excellence, continuous integration, and test-driven development.
