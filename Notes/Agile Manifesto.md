>[!summary]
> The Agile Manifesto prioritizes individuals, collaboration, adaptability, and working software over rigid processes, aiming to shift software development from heavy documentation and fixed plans to iterative, customer-focused delivery, fundamentally transforming project management by emphasizing flexibility, rapid feedback, and continuous improvement.

We are **uncovering** better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:  

## Values of the Agile Manifesto
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
_We follow these principles:_

Our **highest priority** is to satisfy the customer through _early and continuous delivery of valuable software_

**Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage

**Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale

Business people and developers must **work together** daily throughout the project

Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**

**Working software** is the primary _measure of progress_

Agile processes promote _sustainable development_. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain a constant pace indefinitely**

Continuous attention to **technical excellence and good design** enhances agility

**Simplicity**--the art of _maximizing the amount of work not done_--is essential

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly
