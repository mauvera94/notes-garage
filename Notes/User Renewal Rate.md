The percentage of users who renew their subscription or continue using a product after their initial contract period. It serves as a key indicator of customer retention and long-term business sustainability.

It's a specific case of the more general [[User Retention Rate]].

## Why It Matters
A high User Renewal Rate signals *strong customer satisfaction, product-market fit, and predictable recurring revenue*. It is essential for business growth and it increases the [[Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV)]].

> [!formula] 
> $\text{Renewal Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Users Renewing}}{\text{Number of Users Up for Renewal}}$

Alternatively, it can be understood as the inverse of the cancellation rate ([[churn rate]]) for subscription-based businesses, calculated as:

> [!formula] 
> $\text{Cancellation Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Users Lost}}{\text{Number of Users Up for Renewal}}$
> 
> $\text{Renewal Rate} = 1 - \text{Renewal Rate}$

## Key Factors Influencing Renewal Rate

- **User Experience:** A seamless, enjoyable product experience encourages continued use.
- **Competitive Landscape:** If few alternatives exist, users are more likely to stay.
- **Cost-Benefit Perception:** Users must perceive continued value relative to the price.
- **Absence of Negative Experiences:** Minimizing frustration or pain points prevents churn.

## Strategies to Improve Renewal Rate

1. **Frictionless Renewals:** Enable automatic renewals and store payment information securely.
2. **Proactive Reminders:** Notify users before subscription renewals to prevent unexpected charges and refund requests.
3. **Last-Minute Retention Tactics:** Offer limited-time discounts or highlight lost benefits to deter cancellations.
4. **Loyalty Programs & Value Reinforcement:** Showcase past benefits received to increase perceived value.
5. **Handling Unintentional Cancellations:** Remind users of failed payments and retry transactions when necessary.
