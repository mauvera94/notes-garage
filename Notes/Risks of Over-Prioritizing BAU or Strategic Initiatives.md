Risks of Over-Prioritizing BAU or Strategic Initiatives

### Risks of Focusing Too Much on BAU

- **Stagnation:** Lack of innovation can make a business vulnerable to market disruption and competition (See also [[The Innovator's Dilemma]].
- **Technical Debt Accumulation:** While BAU maintains operations, it may not address long-term scalability challenges.
- **Employee Burnout:** Teams may feel uninspired if they work solely on maintenance tasks without opportunities for creative problem-solving.
- **Missed Growth Opportunities:** Focusing only on sustaining existing processes may prevent businesses from capitalizing on emerging trends and technologies.

### Risks of Prioritizing Strategic Initiatives Over BAU

- **Operational Instability:** Neglecting BAU can lead to system failures, security risks, and degraded user experiences.
- **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Lack of focus on BAU tasks such as bug fixes and service reliability may frustrate existing users.
- **Over-investment in Uncertain Returns:** Strategic projects are inherently risky, and over-prioritization may lead to wasted resources on initiatives that do not succeed.
- **Short-Term Chaos:** Transitioning from one major initiative to another without maintaining core business functions can result in internal inefficiencies and confusion.
