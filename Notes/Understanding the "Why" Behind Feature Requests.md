## Why It Matters
Understanding the true reason behind a feature request is critical to ensuring that teams build meaningful and impactful solutions. Without a clear "Why," development can turn into busy work, reducing motivation, blocking better problem-solving approaches, and preventing prioritization based on actual value. A lack of understanding can also lead to misalignment with the product vision and wasted resources.

## The Risks of Ignoring the "Why"
- **Lack of Impact**: Building features without understanding their purpose can result in work that does not contribute to business or user goals.
- **Lower Motivation**: Teams lose engagement when they don't see the rationale behind their efforts.
- **Missed Opportunities**: Without knowing the underlying problem, teams can't explore better, more efficient solutions.
- **No Tradeoff Consideration**: Without a clear reason, it's impossible to properly assess effort versus impact.
- **Weak Prioritization**: Requests without justification lack context for comparison against other initiatives.

## How to Uncover the True Problem

To ensure every feature request is backed by a solid rationale:
- **Document the "Why" Clearly**: Make it a required field in intake forms and PRDs.
- **Always Ask: "What Problem Are We Trying to Solve?"**
- **Gather Evidence**: Ensure there is supporting data or real user pain points justifying the request.
- **Use the Five Whys**: Keep digging deeper by repeatedly asking "why" to uncover the root cause.

## Building a Culture of Justification
To make questioning the "Why" a standard practice:
- **Make It a Requirement in PRDs**: Ensure every request includes a problem statement and expected impact.
- **Empower Teams to Ask Questions**: Encourage open discussions and normalize the expectation of justification.
- **Tie KPIs to the Why**: Measure the success of features based on the original problem they aimed to solve.
