Welcome! I'm [Mau Vera](https://mauvera.me), and you've stumbled upon my working notes—at least the ones I've decided to share. These notes are messy, half-formed, and unapologetically unpolished. If something doesn’t quite make sense, it’s likely because *they’re written primarily for me*. Think of this as an experiment in working with the [garage door open](https://austinkleon.com/2022/12/10/working-with-the-garage-door-open/). Proceed at your own risk!

## Where to begin?

Start wherever you’d like! Explore topics or fall into the rabbit hole by clicking on random note links (Make sure to *checkout the backlinks at the end of each note*). Alternatively, you can begin with these areas of interest, here are a few of my favorites:

- [[§ Product Management]]
- [[§ Product Metrics]]
