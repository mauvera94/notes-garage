The GAME Framework is a step-by-step methodology for making sense of product metrics through a strategic lens. It guides teams to connect business goals with user behaviors and measurable outcomes.

## Core Steps of the GAME Framework

### 1. **Goal** – Define what success looks like.
   - Clarifies the product or feature's primary business objective (e.g., retention, conversion).
   - Acts as the [[North Star Metric]] for subsequent analysis.
   - Often the hardest step due to the ambiguity of strategic priorities.
   - 🔍 *Ask: What does success look like for the product or feature?*

### 2. **Actions** – Map the [[user journey]].
   - Breaks down the user experience into key sequential steps.
   - Reveals friction points and drop-off risks.
   - 🔍 *Ask: What does the user journey look like? What are the key steps users take?*

### 3. **Metrics** – Identify what to measure.
   - Selects 3–5 core indicators aligned with the goal and user actions.
   - See [[§ Product Metrics]] for reference.
   - 🔍 *Ask: What specific numbers or ratios tell us how we’re doing?*

### 4. **Experiments** – Link actions to metric improvements.
   - Proposes UX changes, product iterations, or A/B tests to shift key metrics.
   - Makes the framework actionable through hypothesis-driven changes.
   - 🔍 *Ask: What changes can improve those metrics?*

### 5. **Evaluation** – Assess whether the strategy worked.
   - Uses comparative methods (e.g., cohort analysis) to track progress.
   - Closes the loop and informs the next iteration.
   - 🔍 *Ask: How will you know your changes worked? What benchmarks or comparisons can you use?*

>[!attention]
> GAME is not a static model but a **strategic loop**. As goals evolve, so must the analysis and experimentation. Revisiting the framework regularly ensures alignment with changing user needs and business priorities.
