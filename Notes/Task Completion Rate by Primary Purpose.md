> Traditional [[Conversion Rate]] focuses primarily on transactions, ignoring users who engage with a website for other purposes. Task Completion Rate by Primary Purpose (TCRPP) broadens this view by *assessing whether visitors accomplish their intended task*—whether purchasing, researching, seeking support, or other objectives. 

## Original Methodology
The traditional approach to measuring TCRPP involves directly surveying users to understand their primary purpose and whether they succeeded in completing their task. The method consists of:
- Asking visitors upon arrival: **"Why are you visiting the website today?"** to categorize them into intent-based cohorts (e.g., researching, purchasing, seeking support, etc.).
- Following up after engagement with: **"Were you able to complete your task today?"** to assess success rates within each category.
- Cross-tabulating responses to identify which cohorts experience the most friction and where site improvements are needed.

## Why It Matters
- Many visitors are not on a website to make an immediate purchase, yet their experience still impacts overall business success.
- Understanding why users visit helps optimize for all key audience segments, not just buyers.
- Identifying task failure points across different intent categories provides actionable insights for improving usability and experience.

## Modern Approach
- Rather than explicitly asking users why they are visiting, behavioral analysis can infer intent through page interactions and actions or interact with an AI agent.
- AI-driven models can segment users into intent-based cohorts dynamically.
- Success metrics for each intent category should be clearly defined (e.g., completing a research journey, finding support, registering a product).

## Key Benefits
1. **Holistic Website Optimization** – Improves experience for all visitors, not just those converting into buyers.
2. **Identifies Pain Points** – Reveals where users struggle to complete tasks, offering clear opportunities for improvement.
3. **Boosts Long-Term Engagement** – Enhancing task completion across all segments builds trust and increases the likelihood of future conversions.
