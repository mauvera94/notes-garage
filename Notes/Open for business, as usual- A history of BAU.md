The phrase "business as usual" dates back to the late 19th century, when it was commonly used by businesses to indicate that they remained open despite external disruptions such as weather conditions or construction. This usage reassured customers that operations would continue unaffected.

> ”We are open for business, as usual"

The expression gained significant prominence during World War I. Initially, British politicians believed the war would not disrupt trade and commerce, using "business as usual" to maintain public confidence. As the war progressed and disruptions became inevitable, the phrase evolved into a rallying cry, symbolizing resilience and determination. Winston Churchill was among the key figures who helped popularize the term in this context.

Today, the term has been adopted in corporate and operational settings ([[Business as Usual (BAU) in Business Operations]]) to distinguish routine tasks from strategic initiatives, emphasizing continuity and stability in business operations.
