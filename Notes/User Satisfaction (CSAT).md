> CSAT is a **highly subjective metric** that provides a snapshot of satisfaction for a specific cohort at a given time. It is influenced by biases, extreme responses, and survey participation patterns. As a result, it should be taken with a grain of salt and not be the sole indicator of customer experience or improvement success.

Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) is a metric used to measure how satisfied users are with a product, service, or experience. It is typically determined through surveys or in-app feedback mechanisms, often using rating scales such as stars, numerical rankings (e.g., 1-5), or emojis.

**Key Influences on CSAT:**

- **Expectation vs. Reality:** Satisfaction is strongly influenced by whether the actual experience matches or exceeds user expectations.
- **Enjoyment and Ease of Use:** The level of pleasure and ease a user experiences while interacting with the product or service.
- **Service Quality:** In customer support, responsiveness, helpfulness, and resolution effectiveness impact satisfaction.
- **Feature Effectiveness:** CSAT can also measure satisfaction with specific actions, features, or interactions within a product.

## Limitations and Bias in CSAT:

- **Extreme Bias:** CSAT scores tend to be influenced disproportionately by users who had either very positive or very negative experiences, as neutral users may be less likely to respond.
- **Survey Bias:** Only a vocal cohort may participate in CSAT surveys, leading to an overrepresentation of specific user groups. Silent sufferers (dissatisfied users who do not provide feedback) and silent promoters (satisfied users who do not leave positive feedback) may skew results.
- **Subjectivity and Timeframe Comparisons:**Â CSAT is **highly subjective** and captures the sentiment of a specific cohort at a given time. Different user groups may experience different issues or resolutions, making it difficult to compare CSAT scores across time periods accurately. This means improvements made to a product or service may not always be reflected in CSAT trends, as each cohort applies different criteria to their evaluations.

## Applications of CSAT:

- **Customer Support:** Evaluating user satisfaction after a support interaction.
- **Product Reviews:** Measuring satisfaction through ratings in app stores, marketplaces, or review platforms.
- **Business Performance:** Gauging overall satisfaction with a company's products or services.
- **Feature-Specific Feedback:** Assessing how satisfied users are with a newly introduced feature or functionality.
