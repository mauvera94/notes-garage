Stickiness in a product refers to how frequently users return and engage with it over time. A common metric for measuring stickiness is the **[[Daily Active Users (DAU)|DAU]]/[[Monthly Active Users (MAU)|MAU]] ratio** (AVG Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users). This ratio indicates how often users engage with the product within a given period. A higher percentage suggests stronger habitual usage and user retention.
