Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) represents the total earnings a company generates from a customer over the entire duration of their relationship. It can be expressed for an individual customer or as an average across a customer base.

### Importance of CLV

- A higher CLV indicates greater revenue potential and customer loyalty.
- It helps businesses assess whether customer acquisition and retention strategies are profitable.
- CLV can guide segmentation strategies, identifying high-value customer cohorts for targeted efforts.
- It informs loss ratios, ensuring that certain customer retention efforts are worth the investment.

### Calculation of CLV

The simplest way to calculate CLV is by summing all earnings from a customer from onboarding to date or until churn.

> $CLV = \text{Average Purchase Value} \times \text{Purchase Frequency} \times \text{Customer Lifespan}$

### Factors Influencing CLV

- **Purchase Frequency**: How often a customer makes purchases.
- **Total Ticket Value**: The average amount spent per transaction.
- **Retention Rate**: The duration a customer continues purchasing from the business.
- - **Customer Service Quality**: A good experience leads to higher retention and repeat purchases.
- **Brand Loyalty and Engagement**: Strong relationships and community-building efforts increase CLV.
- **Market Competition**: Competitive pricing and unique value propositions affect customer retention.
- **Personalization and Recommendations**: Tailored offers improve purchase frequency and order value.

### Strategies to Improve CLV

- Increase purchase frequency through loyalty programs, subscriptions, or engagement campaigns.
- Increase the average order value by upselling or offering higher-value products.
- Enhance customer retention by improving satisfaction and reducing [[churn rate]].

### CLV and [[Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)]]

The CLV-to-CAC ratio determines if customer acquisition strategies are sustainable. Ideally:

- A **CLV-to-CAC ratio greater than 1:1** indicates profitability.
- A **ratio lower than 1:1** means the company is losing money per customer, requiring strategy adjustments.
