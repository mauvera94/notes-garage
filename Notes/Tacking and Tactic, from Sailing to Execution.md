Although they now have different primary meanings, the concepts of _tacking_ and _tactic_ are fundamentally related in terms of **adaptive strategy and maneuvering**:

- **Tacking (in sailing):** This refers to **changing direction by adjusting sails and zigzagging against the wind**, rather than moving in a straight line. It is a method of indirect but controlled movement, making the best use of available conditions.
- **Tactic (Strategy & Planning):** A tactic is **a calculated maneuver** in military, business, or life to achieve a specific goal. Like tacking in sailing, tactics often involve **adapting, shifting approaches, and adjusting positioning in response to conditions**.

## Why This Matters

>[!idea]
> By the 1670s, people started using “*tack*” in a figurative way to mean a **strategy or approach to achieve a goal**. This meaning came from the idea of a ship **temporarily changing direction** to take advantage of the wind.

The connection between the two suggests that good tactics, whether in battle, business, or personal life, often involve _tacking_—adjusting, pivoting, and strategically shifting approaches rather than brute-forcing a solution. This reinforces the idea that success often comes not from moving directly forward, but from **adapting to obstacles and changing conditions effectively**.

Both concepts emphasize adaptability and calculated actions to reach a desired outcome.

Just as [Edward Sewall” rounding of the Cape Horn](https://www.sail-world.com/Australia/Tales-Of-The-Notorious-Cape/-5244) changed direction to achieve a goal; it took 67 days to make this crossing instead of the estimated 10.

>In sailing by late 14c.; specifically meaning "rope or hooked wire to hold the lower corner of a sail in place" by late 15c. The extended sense of "course of a ship in relation to the position of her sails" is by 1610s. Hence **the figurative use for "tactical procedure, course of conduct or mode of action suited to some purpose"** (1670s), attested earlier in the verb (1630s). **The notion is "temporary change in direction to take advantage of a side-wind."**
