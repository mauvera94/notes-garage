Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely used customer loyalty metric calculated as the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors. It is based on the question: *"How likely are you to recommend [product/service] to a friend or colleague?"* with responses on a 0-10 scale. 

- **Promoters (9-10):** Loyal customers likely to advocate for the brand. They are enthusiastic and likely to drive positive word-of-mouth.
- **Passives (7-8):** Neutral customers who may not actively promote or detract. They are satisfied but not actively engaged.
- **Detractors (0-6):** Unhappy customers who may discourage others from using the product. They may spread negative feedback.

## Why NPS Matters  
- It provides a simple, low-friction way to gauge customer sentiment.
- It serves as a proxy for customer loyalty and product value.
- It is easy to track over time and benchmark against competitors.

## Limitations and Criticism  
- The question is **hypothetical** and may not reflect actual customer behavior.
- Survey biases, can distort results.
- It does not provide granular insights into *why* customers feel a certain way.

## Real-World Applications  
NPS is commonly collected through post-interaction surveys, emails, or pop-ups after customer support interactions, product onboarding, or new feature releases. Businesses use NPS to assess brand advocacy, identify customer pain points, and prioritize improvements.

## Related Concepts  
- [[Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)]] Measures immediate satisfaction with a specific interaction.
- [[Virality Coefficient]] The extent to which customers share and promote a product organically.
- [[Customer Referral Rate (CRR)]] Tracks actual referrals rather than just intent.
