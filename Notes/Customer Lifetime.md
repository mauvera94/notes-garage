## Measuring Customer Lifetime

> Where churn rate is the percentage of customers who stop using a product within a given period.

Other approaches may involve *cohort analysis* (grouping users by shared characteristics over time to track retention patterns), *survival analysis* (estimating the probability of customers remaining active over time), or *predictive modeling based on behavioral data* (using machine learning to forecast customer engagement and churn).
