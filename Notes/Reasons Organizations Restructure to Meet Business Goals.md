Reorganizations are often **triggered by the need to correct inefficiencies** (Eg. redundant processes, poor communication across teams, bottlenecks in decision-making, misallocation of resourcesâ€¦), improve alignment with strategic goals, or respond to leadership changes. Common patterns include consolidating teams to improve collaboration, shifting focus areas to align with business priorities, and reallocating resources to more critical initiatives.
