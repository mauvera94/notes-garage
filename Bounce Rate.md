**Bounce rate** represents the percentage of visitors who leave a website after viewing only a single page, without interacting further or navigating to other pages on the site. It is commonly used as a measure of website "stickiness"—how effectively a website engages users beyond their initial entry.

> $\text{Bounce Rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of visitors viewing only one page}}{\text{Total entries to the page}}$  


#### **When Does a Bounce Occur?**
A bounce occurs when a visitor:  
- Closes the browser or app.  
- Clicks the "Back" button to leave the site.  
- Navigates to another website through a link.  
- Types a new URL into the browser.  
- Experiences session timeout as defined by the analytics software.  

#### **Interpreting Bounce Rate**
- **High bounce rates** may indicate a lack of engagement or relevance. However, for certain types of websites—such as those providing concise information or landing pages with specific calls-to-action—a high bounce rate may not signal a problem.  
- **Low bounce rates** typically suggest visitors are engaging with multiple pages, indicating a higher level of interest or interaction.
- Bounce rate is also one kind of the more general [[Drop Off Rate]] where a visitor doesn't continue in the flow after the paged viewed.
