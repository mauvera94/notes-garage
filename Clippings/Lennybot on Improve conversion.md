- > How do I improve my conversion?
    
- > Improving conversion is one of the highest-leverage moves you can make—it’s like fixing leaks in a bucket. Here’s how I’d approach it:
    > 
    > ### 1. **Keep users in the flow**
    > 
    > - **Maintain focus**: Remove distractions that pull users away from completing their task. For example, at Airbnb, we found that opening listings in a new tab helped users stay on track without losing their place in the search flow. Similarly, removing overly engaging content (like the "Neighborhoods" feature) from the homepage increased bookings because it reduced distractions .
    > - **Set smart defaults**: Simplify decision-making by pre-filling fields or suggesting defaults. For example, when onboarding new Airbnb hosts, we added recommended answers for questions like pricing and availability, which sped up the process and improved completion rates .
    > - **Guide users with clear steps**: Show progress indicators or remind users how close they are to completing a task. For example, letting hosts know they were “just X steps away” from publishing their listing was a big win .
    > 
    > ### 2. **Maintain user motivation**
    > 
    > - **Leverage scarcity**: Create urgency by showing limited availability or high demand. For example, messaging like “This property is usually booked” or “Only 2 left at this price” can nudge users to act .
    > - **Highlight value**: Remind users why they’re making the decision. For Airbnb, emphasizing the income potential for hosts throughout the onboarding flow was a huge motivator .
    > - **Build trust**: Trust is critical for conversion. Features like Airbnb’s Host Guarantee reassured users that they were protected, which encouraged them to move forward .
    > 
    > ### 3. **Reduce friction**
    > 
    > - **Simplify the process**: Remove unnecessary steps or make them optional. For example, Airbnb’s shift to Instant Book (eliminating the host approval process) was one of the biggest drivers of guest conversion .
    > - **Improve performance**: Slow-loading pages kill conversion, especially on mobile. Investing in performance optimization can make a surprisingly big difference .
    > - **Personalize the experience**: Tailor the flow to the user’s context. For example, showing only available listings when users input dates reduced frustration and improved booking rates .
    > 
    > ### 4. **Bring users back into the flow**
    > 
    > - **Re-engagement campaigns**: Use email, push notifications, or retargeting ads to remind users to complete their action. For example, Airbnb sent emails reminding users that a home they viewed was still available or that prices had dropped. These nudges were highly effective .
    > - **Provide new information**: If something has changed (e.g., a price drop or new availability), let users know. This can re-spark their interest .
    > - **Make it easy to return**: Include a clear call-to-action in re-engagement messages, like “Click here to pick up where you left off” .
    > 
    > ### 5. **Experiment relentlessly**
    > 
    > - Test everything. At Airbnb, we ran hundreds of experiments at any given time to optimize conversion. If you don’t have the volume for A/B testing, rely on user research and intuition, but always iterate .
    > - Focus on the biggest bottlenecks in your funnel. Don’t spread yourself too thin—identify the step with the highest drop-off and prioritize fixing that .
    > 
    > ### Final thought
    > 
    > Conversion optimization is a never-ending process. Start by identifying the biggest leaks in your funnel, then systematically apply these principles. And remember, even small improvements compound over time. Which part of your funnel feels like the biggest challenge right now? Let’s dig into that!
