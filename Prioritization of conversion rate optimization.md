When prioritizing [[Conversion Rate Optimization]] initiatives, focus on addressing the lowest [[Conversion Rate]] or the highest [[Drop Off Rate]] in your funnel first. Targeting these [[bottleneck]] yields the greatest potential impact because even marginal improvements can cascade downstream through subsequent stages, compounding overall performance gains.

This provides significant advantages:

1. **Improved Funnel Efficiency**: By fixing the weakest links, the entire conversion process becomes more streamlined, resulting in measurable improvements in customer acquisition or retention.

2. **Data-Driven Impact Measurement**: By using this framework you are using data decision making, enhancements at the lowest-converting step are often the easiest to track, providing clear, impartial results, and actionable feedback for future optimization efforts.
