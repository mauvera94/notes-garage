This is a simple footnote[^1].
Multiple lines[^2].
With name[^note] but as number in preview.
With content not at the end[^4]

[^4]: Separated by lines.

```markdown
[^#] 
[^#]:
```

[^1]: This is the referenced text.
[^2]: Add 2 spaces at the start of each new line.
  This lets you write footnotes that span multiple lines.
[^note]: Named footnotes still appear as numbers, but can make it easier to identify and link references.
