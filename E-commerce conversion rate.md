E-commerce conversion rate is a specific application of the general [[Overall Product Conversion Rate]], referring to the **percentage of visitors to an online store who complete a purchase**. This metric is essential for evaluating the performance of e-commerce sites and is calculated using the following formula:

>[!formula]
>${\text{E-commerce\ CR\ \%}}=\dfrac{Orders}{\text{Website visits}}$

The e-commerce conversion rate is calculated based on *the number of sessions (visits) rather than unique users*. Reporting based on users inflates the conversion rate and misrepresents actual performance.

> Ensure the orders and visits are taken from the same time period to maintain accuracy.
